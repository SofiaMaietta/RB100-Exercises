# In the code below, two arrays containing several numbers are assigned to two variables, array1 and array2. Compare array1 and array2 and print true or false based on whether they match.

array1 = [1, 5, 9]
array2 = [1, 9, 5]

if array1 == array2
  puts "true"
else
  puts "false"
end 

# Remember that in arrays, order matters, so they must be identical to be equal.
