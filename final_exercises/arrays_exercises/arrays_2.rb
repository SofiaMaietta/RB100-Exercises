# In the code below, an array containing different types of pets is assigned to pets.

# Write some code that selects 'fish' and 'lizard' from the pets array - select the two items at the same time. Assign the return value to a variable named my_pets, then print the contents of my_pets as a single string.

# Make sure you use my_pets to get the words "fish" and "lizard" in that message.
