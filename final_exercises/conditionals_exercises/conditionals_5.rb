# What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

number = 7

if number
  puts "My favorite number is #{number}."
else
  puts "I don't have a favorite number."
end

# This code will print "My favorite number is 7." because number is treated as a truthy value. Every expression evaluates as true when used in a condition except false and nil, which are falsy.
