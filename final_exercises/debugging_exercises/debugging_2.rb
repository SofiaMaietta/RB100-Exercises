# August 7, 2024     Weather Forecast

# Our predict_weather method should output a message indicating whether a sunny or cloudy day lies ahead. However, the output is the same every time the method is invoked. Why? Fix the code so that it behaves as expected.

# def predict_weather
#   sunshine = ['true', 'false'].sample

#   if sunshine
#     puts "Today's weather will be sunny!"
#   else
#     puts "Today's weather will be cloudy!"
#   end
# end

def predict_weather
  sunshine = [true, false].sample

  if sunshine
    puts "Today's weather will be sunny!"
  else
    puts "Today's weather will be cloudy!"
  end
end

predict_weather

# the value referenced by sunshine will always be a String object, which is truthy and therefore will always be evaluated as true, so you need to assign sunshine to the Boolean true or false instead of the string 'true' or 'false'.
