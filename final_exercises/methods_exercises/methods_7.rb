# Run the code as it is shown below, and take notice of any error messages. Based on what the error messages are telling you, update the relevant method definitions and method invocations as necessary so that the names are printed as shown below.

# The dog's name is Spot.
# The cat's name is Ginger.

# def dog
#   return name
# end

# def cat(name)
#   return name
# end

# puts "The dog's name is #{dog('Spot')}."
# puts "The cat's name is #{cat}."

def dog(name)
  return name
end

def cat(name)
  return name
end

puts "The dog's name is #{dog('Spot')}."

puts "The cat's name is #{cat('Ginger')}."

# When you're writing methods, it's important to keep track of how many arguments the method accepts and how many it's given upon invocation. Both numbers need to match or an error will be thrown.
