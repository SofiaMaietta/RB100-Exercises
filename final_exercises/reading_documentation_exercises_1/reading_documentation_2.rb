# August 11, 2024    While Loops

# Locate the description of the while loop in the Ruby documentation.



# Select the core API link for your version of Ruby.

# Select the "control expressions" link.

# Search within the page for "while" until you find the "while loop" discussion.

# The "control expressions" page is where you will find discussions of most language features that control code flow: conditionals (if, unless, case), basic looping (while, until, for), loop termination (break, next), and several other features of the language.
