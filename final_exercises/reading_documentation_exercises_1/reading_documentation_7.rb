# August 11, 2024     String Class

# Let's move on now to the documentation you will use most often; the core API section on Classes and Modules. All of these are listed under Classes on the Core API page.

# Don't worry too much about the term "class". For now, think of classes as data types: numbers, character strings, arrays, hashes, symbols, etc.

# Locate and open the class documentation for the String class.


# I typed in String in the search bar. 


# On the left-hand side, instance methods are identified with a #, e.g., #size, while class methods and module methods are identified with a ::, e.g., ::new. 

# This is merely a documentation convention; the # and :: are not part of the method names, nor are they used to refer to methods in your programs. You will also see this notation prefixed by a class or module name; for instance, you may see String#size or Array#size, Range::new or Hash::new. This notation simply means that the named method is a member of the specified class or module.
