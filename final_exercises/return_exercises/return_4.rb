# August 9, 2024     Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner? (Part 4)

# What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

def meal
  puts 'Dinner'
  return 'Breakfast'
end

puts meal

# This code will print 'Dinner' and 'Breakfast' because there are two puts which means both values will be printed.
