# August 9, 2024      Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner? (Part 5)

# What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

def meal
  'Dinner'
  puts 'Dinner'
end

p meal

# This code will print 'Dinner' and nil. 

# 'Dinner' prints because there is a puts before it.

# Nil prints because p will print the return value of the method, which is nil, because puts always returns nil.
