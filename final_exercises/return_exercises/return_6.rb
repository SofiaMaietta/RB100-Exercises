# August 9, 2024     Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner? (Part 6)

# What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

def meal
  return 'Breakfast'
  'Dinner'
  puts 'Dinner'
end

puts meal

# This code will print 'Breakfast' because the explicit return causes the method to exit after the code on line 6 is run.
